Freedomapp for Android
=========
This application was made by Oscar Rydén, Adam Torkelsson, Erik Gidlund and Pär Linder at Chalmers in the spring of 2013.
The idea behind this application is to create a map where you make the 
user responsible to make it interesting. We wanted to make it easy 
for users to share different locations and events with other people.
## Requirements to use this application
SDK 11; (Target SDK 17)
Internet Connection 
GPS
## Permissions this application uses
permission.MAPS_RECEIVE
permission.INTERNET
permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
permission.READ_GSERVICES
permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
permission.CAMERA
## External dependencies used by this application
Google play services - Google Map
## Motivation and explanation for some programming choices
We have chosen to use Google Maps as an external dependency since we wanted 
our application to revolve around locations and events and their position on the map.
Googles API and map is highly developed and made it possible to create the application we wanted.
We have chosen SDK 11 because the Google Maps v2 requires this.

We diden't choose to apply the new NotifyService since this required 
a higher level of SDK and reduced the amount of possible number of users.
The design focuses on the map as the heart activity to make it easy for the users to see events and locations near them directly when they start the application. A tutorial is made for users who are not familiar with the application. The colors and design patterns were chosen both to give a nice esthetically look and make it easy for users to understand how to interact.
